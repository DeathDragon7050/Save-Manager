# Save-Manager (v1.4)
Note: This file used to be on nexus mods and has permanently been moved here

## Description
Save Manager is a tool that lets you easily and quickly backup and load different characters and saves from games. Backing up works by going through your current saves folder and copying everything and putting it into a backup folder that is named after the character (and a marker if you so choose so). Loading works by allowing you to choose any one of your backups and copy pasting them into your current folder. The program will tell you exactly what it is going to do with everything so there is no chance that it will ruin any of your saves. It also does nothing in the background and only operates when you tell it to. I made it to be as clear as possible. Backing up and loading can take a while if you have a lot of save files.

**_PLEASE report any and all bugs and/or suggestions!_**

## Installation
Run the installer and install it in a folder wherever you want. (Something like C:\\Save Manager) Do not install in program files folder!
Run the main file and configure settings - a configuration file will automatically be created

## Updating
Download the latest version
Run the installer and install it in the same folder that you have the old version
(Make sure you overwrite the old version!)

## Compatibility
The program is compatible almost any game. The only requirements are that the saves for the particular game are just individual files in a folder (like Skyrim and all modern Bethesda Games (I'm pretty sure)) but not have each individual save in an individual folder. If you don't understand what i mean, to put it simply, if the folder that contains the saves has no folders within it, you're good to go. Also its windows exclusive

## Changing Installation Folder
You can uninstall and reinstall the program wherever you want, all your settings are saved in config.ini so you could reinstall the program wherever you want and then move your config file to that folder.

## Uninstalling
Simply delete the files and it will be gone forever :(
Also let me know why you decided you don't like the app. Maybe I could improve it from your suggestions.
