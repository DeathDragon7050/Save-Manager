# Save-Manager
Save Manager is a tool that lets you easily and quickly backup and load different characters and saves. The program will tell you exactly what it is going to do with everything so there is no chance that it will ruin any of your saves. It also does nothing in the background and only operates when you tell it to. I made it to be as clear as possible
